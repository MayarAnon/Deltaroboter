# Delta Robot Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Delta Robot Project. This project encompasses a complete implementation of a simulated delta robot system, including both frontend and backend components. It serves as a platform for controlling and visualizing the movements of the delta robot in real-time.

## Project Overview

The Delta Robot Project is designed to demonstrate the principles of robotics control and simulation. It includes a modular web application developed using React, facilitating real-time communication through WebSockets and MQTT.

## Features

- **Real-time Control and Visualization**: Control and observe the delta robot within an interactive 3D environment.
- **G-Code Support**: Load, edit, and execute G-Code to control the robot movements.
- **Manual Control**: Direct control over the robot's movements through manual inputs.
- **System State Monitoring**: Monitor and display the current state of the robot.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, Recoil, ThreeJS, WebSocket
- **Backend**:  Express, MQTT, PIGPIO, RPIGPIO

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MayarAnon/Deltaroboter.git
   cd Deltaroboter
## Usage
After starting the application, you can access the web interface via http://localhost:3000 to control and observe the delta robot.
